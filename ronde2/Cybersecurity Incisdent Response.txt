Cybersecurity Incisdent Response, Digital Forensics Investigation
a. Incident Response Work Task Server, Web Server :
	Deteksi dan Identifikasi: Identifikasi insiden, nilai tingkat keparahannya, dan tentukan cakupan dampaknya
		CARA DETEKSI & IDENTIFIKASI : 
		- Analisis Log untuk melihat apakah ada anomali
		- Analisis Traffic Jaringan NetFlow, PIFIX, Pola traffic
		- Memonitor sistem, CPU USAGE, MEMORY USAGE, DISK USAGE, Bisa menggunakan Nagios, Prometheus atau Grafana
		- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Snort / Suricata mendeteksi potensi ancaman
		- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), mengumpulkan memonitor data terkait keamanan dari berbagai sumber


	Initial Response: Isolasi server atau sistem yang terkena dampak untuk mencegah kerusakan lebih lanjut, dan beri tahu tim respons insiden.
	Containment / Pengendalian: Menerapkan tindakan untuk mengatasi insiden tersebut, seperti mematikan server, memutuskan sambungan dari jaringan, atau membatasi akses.
	Recovery / Pemulihan: Memulihkan server ke kondisi baik, termasuk menginstal ulang perangkat lunak, memulihkan data dari cadangan, dan mengonfigurasi ulang pengaturan sistem.
	Post-Incident Activities / Kegiatan Pasca-Insiden: Melakukan analisis pasca-insiden untuk mengidentifikasi akar penyebab, mendokumentasikan pembelajaran, dan menerapkan perbaikan 	untuk mencegah insiden serupa di masa depan.





b. Incident Response Work Task Server, File Server

Detection and Identification:

Analyze File Server logs for anomalies, such as unusual file access patterns or unauthorized changes to file permissions.
Monitor network traffic to and from the File Server using tools like NetFlow, PIFIX, or traffic analysis software.
Use system monitoring tools like Nagios, Prometheus, or Grafana to track CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and other system metrics.
Implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) like Snort or Suricata to detect potential threats.
Utilize Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to collect and monitor security-related data from various sources.

Initial Response:

Isolate the affected File Server or system to prevent further damage and notify the incident response team.
Contain the incident by restricting access to the File Server or shutting it down temporarily.

Containment/Pengendalian:

Implement measures to mitigate the incident, such as:
Restricting access to sensitive files or folders.
Disabling file sharing or network access.
Implementing temporary access controls or authentication mechanisms.
Perform a thorough analysis of the incident to determine the scope and impact.

Recovery/Pemulihan:

Restore the File Server to a known good state, including:
Reinstalling software and firmware.
Restoring data from backups.
Reconfiguring system settings and access controls.
Verify the integrity of files and data to ensure they have not been compromised.

Post-Incident Activities/Kegiatan Pasca-Insiden:

Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify the root cause of the incident.
Document lessons learned and implement improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Update incident response procedures and training to reflect the lessons learned.

File Server:

In the context of incident response, a File Server is a critical asset that requires special attention. Here are some key considerations:

File System Analysis: Analyze the file system for signs of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or malicious activity.
File Integrity Monitoring: Implement file integrity monitoring tools to detect changes to files or folders.
Access Control: Review and update access controls, including permissions, ACLs, and file sharing settings.
Data Backup and Recovery: Ensure that regular backups are performed, and data can be restored in case of a disaster or incident.



Key differences:

Purpose: A File Server is designed for file storage and sharing, while a Web Server is designed for hosting and serving web content.
Protocols: File Servers use file sharing protocols (e.g., SMB, NFS), while Web Servers use web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).
Access: File Servers provide access to files and folders, while Web Servers provide access to web content and applications.
Security: File Servers typically require stronger access controls and authentication mechanisms, as they store sensitive files and data. Web Servers, on the other hand, require security measures to protect against web-based attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).



c. Vulnerability Detection and Repair, Web Server

Vulnerability Detection:

Vulnerability detection is the process of identifying potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities in a web server's configuration, software, or hardware. The goal is to detect vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.

Here are some common methods for vulnerability detection in web servers:

Network Scanning: Network scanning tools, such as Nmap, Nessus, or OpenVAS, are used to identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities in the web server's network configuration.
Web Application Scanning: Web application scanning tools, such as Burp Suite, ZAP, or Acunetix, are used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
Configuration Scanning: Configuration scanning tools, such as Nessus or OpenVAS, are used to identify misconfigurations or weaknesses in the web server's configuration files, such as Apache or IIS.
Log Analysis: Log analysis tools, such as Splunk or ELK, are used to analyze web server logs to identify potential security incidents or vulnerabilities.
Penetration Testing: Penetration testing, also known as pen testing or ethical hacking, involves simulating a cyber attack on the web server to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.


Vulnerability Repair:

Once vulnerabilities are detected, it's essential to repair or remediate them to prevent exploitation. Here are some common methods for vulnerability repair in web servers:

Patch Management: Apply security patches and updates to the web server's operating system, software, and applications to fix known vulnerabilities.
Configuration Hardening: Harden the web server's configuration by disabling unnecessary services, closing open ports, and restricting access to sensitive areas.  
Vulnerability Mitigation: Implement mitigation measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent exploitation of identified vulnerabilities.
Web Application Firewall (WAF) Configuration: Configure a WAF, such as ModSecurity or OWASP, to detect and prevent web-based attacks.
Incident Response: Develop an incident response plan to quickly respond to security incidents and minimize the impact of a breach.
