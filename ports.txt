ADMIN$ - Administrative shares are hidden network shares created by the Windows NT family of
operating systems that allow system administrators to have remote access to every disk volume on a
network-connected system. These shares may not be permanently deleted but may be disabled.

pipes and is not part of the file system.

LFI or Local File Inclusion occurs when an attacker is able to get a website to include a file that was not
intended to be an option for this application. A common example is when an application uses the path to a
file as input. If the application treats this input as trusted, and the required sanitary checks are not
performed on this input, then the attacker can exploit it by using the ../ string in the inputted file name
and eventually view sensitive files in the local file system. In some limited cases, an LFI can lead to code

RFI or Remote File Inclusion is similar to LFI but in this case it is possible for an attacker to load a remote
file on the host using protocols like HTTP, FTP etc.
execution as well.

NTLM (New Technology Lan Manager)
The NTLM authentication process is done in the following way :
1. The client sends the user name and domain name to the server.
2. The server generates a random character string, referred to as the challenge.
3. The client encrypts the challenge with the NTLM hash of the user password and sends it back to the
server.
4. The server retrieves the user password (or equivalent).
5. The server uses the hash value retrieved from the security account database to encrypt the challenge
string. The value is then compared to the value received from the client. If the values match, the client
is authenticated
